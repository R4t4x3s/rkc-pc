> The wget -qO- command is used to download content from a web URL and display it to the standard output.
> -q : This option stands for quiet mode, which means that wget will not output any status information while downloading.
> -O- : This option is used to specify where the downloaded content should be saved. In this case, the hyphen - indicates that > the content should be redirected to the standard output (usually the terminal).
> So when you run wget -qO- <URL> , the content of the specified URL will be downloaded and displayed in the terminal without > any additional status information
